![logo](./docs/img/logo.png)

The main API is in `DotNetLightning.Core` project/assembly.

## Installation

The package is compiled and published in nuget:

* [`DotNetLightning.Kiss`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotNetLightning.Kiss/)

It does not use native bindings for cryptographic operations.

Currently it is in beta, so you probably want to install a latest version by specifying it with `--version`.
The version is prefixed with git commit hash and date. Please take a look at the nuget page.

## Features

See our [API document](https://joemphilips.github.io/DotNetLightning) for full features.
